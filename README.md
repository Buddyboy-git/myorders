# myorders


MANUFACTURER = 
SUPPLIER =
JOBBER =
STORE =
CUSTOMER = 

This project pertains to the FOOD and FOOD products industry.

This project seeks to automate the entire order chain process. This will be the whoole kit and kaboodle. 
I am initially starting with automating the process of JOBBERS ordering from their SUPPLIERS.
Then I will expand to allowing STORES to order directly from their JOBBERS.

Eventually/Theoretically - A customer can place an order for a product from a MANUFACTURER and have it shipped to a STORE for pickup.
